# NameC

C/C++ code generator library

## Concept

Our goal is to provide simple and handy APIs enough to generate C/C++ code easily from your application.
Note that this library does not aim at supporting complete and sound APIs for C/C++ syntax.

## Installation by CMake

Build and installation is by basic CMake workflow.

## Getting started

- Link the library file lib/NameC.lib
- Include the header include/NameC.h for C code generation. It provides the namespace namec.
- Include the header include/NameCXX.h for C++ code generation. It provides the namespace namecxx.
- Read the doxygen documentation in doc directory in the release build. Top pages of each namespace works as good index.
